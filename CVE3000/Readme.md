## Prerequisites for this script:

- **Python environment**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system and that you can execute Python scripts using the command line with "python".
- **`winget` command**: This command is used to download files. If "winget" is not available on your system, you can use "python-3.12.1-amd64.exe" as an alternative.
- **Chrome browser**: Make sure the Chrome browser is installed and can be launched from the command line or desktop icon.

Make sure these prerequisites are met; otherwise, you may encounter problems with certain steps in the script. For example, if "winget" is missing, the download step will fail; if the Python environment is not set up, Python-related instructions cannot be executed.
