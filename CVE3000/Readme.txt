The prerequisites for this script are the following tools and environment:

- Python environment: Ensure that Python is installed on the system and that Python scripts can be executed using the command line with `python`.
- `wget` command: This command is used to download files. If `wget` is not available on the system, you can use `python-3.12.1-amd64.exe` as an alternative.
- Chrome browser: It's used to open HTML files for filling out. Please make sure that Chrome browser is installed and can be launched from the command line or desktop icon.

Need to ensure that these prerequisites are met; otherwise, certain steps in the script may encounter issues. 
For instance, if `wget` is missing, the download step will fail; if the Python environment is not set up, Python-related commands cannot be executed, etc.
